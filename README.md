# Seeed grove air602 UART wifi

## Introduction
The Air602 is a 2.4G Wi-Fi module based on the embedded Wi-Fi SoC chip (W600) with a  12-pin Stamp Hole Expansion Interface. 

The air602 UART wifi module receive AT command,So arduino board can control it via UART port.  

## Notice
* Since atmega328(like arduino UNO) has only one serial port,The library use hardware serial port to output log info,and control the Air602 via softserial(2,3)ï¼ŒSo the grove cable should attach to (D2,D3) port.  

* When using the samd board(like arduino zero,seeeduino cortex M0+),the SerialUSB for printing log info.The Serial(defined in library)for send AT command.  

* By default, The arduino board outputs the instruction info while sending AT command to air602 wifi module,user can close it in file:ATSerial.h,change the DEBUG_EN from 1 to 0.
